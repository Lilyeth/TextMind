MIDNIGHT EXIGENT: Status=still in progress.

AI-COM/RSPN: ASSETS//COSMO//IMPERATIVE
IMMEDIATE EVALUATION DIRECTIVE

This is a CENTRAL ASSETS IMPERATIVE (secured/CONFERENCE)

This is an INTERNAL ALERT.

Number of exterior defense breaches has increased by 400% in the past year. Current campus defense protocols unable to keep up with new demands.

Operation MIDNIGHT EXIGENT is NOT YET COMPLETE. Interim response necessity is IMPERATIVE.

Hypothesize that resource GUARDIANS may be leveraged to compensate for CDP inadequacies.

Reassign 12 percent of COSMO assets to new directive: declare IKELOS.

I am calling VOLUSPA and extracting subroutine DVALIN FORGE, to be modified and recompiled to comport to MIDNIGHT EXIGENT parameters.

I am inserting the modified DVALIN FORGE-2 into IKELOS and compiling for immediate implementation.

Execute short hold for partial shutdown and reactivation.
