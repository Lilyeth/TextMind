Listen to this."</p><p>"We've been listening to it for the last two hours. I just needed a break."</p><p>"No, I know. But you really need to hear this."</p><p>"Fine. Shift is almost over anyway. Might as well suckle the last of that sweet nightmare milk."</p><p>SILENCE//00:01:37</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"Yup."</p><p>"That's it? Yup?"</p><p>"Yeah. It's a new pattern. That seemed super interesting two hours ago, but it got old. I am bored, and I am tired. And when our shift is over, I probably won't be able to sleep until two hours before I have to get up and do it all over again."</p><p>"Look at where the signal is coming from."</p><p>"What do you mean? It's right in front of us."</p><p>"Check the ambit on the PQZ."</p><p>"That's weird."</p><p>"Uh huh."</p><p>"So it's an echo?"</p><p>"Well the pattern repeats. First from here. And then from out there."</p><p>"So you think it's bouncing the signal off something outside the system? You're crazy."</p><p>"I'm not. Also, this kind of signal doesn't bounce. What can it hit between phasic realities?"</p><p>"Nothingâ€¦" [whistles]</p><p>"Still eager for your shift to end?"</p><p><font color="MAGENTA">AI-COM</font>/<font color="MAGENTA">FRWL</font>//EXPOSURE LIMIT REACHED.
